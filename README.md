# Intro

App Store Connect API access using your private API key. The great power of this tool is that it can operate on all apps of one or multiple teams (is you wish to), e.g. it is super easy to print the live versions of all of your apps, even across multiple teams:

```shell
for asc_api_key_id in key_id_1 key_id_2 key_id_3; do
  asc app-store-versions list -k "$asc_api_key_id"
done
```

## Features

- **Take control over Apple's App Store Connect API** on the command line, e.g. invite new beta testers, update beta groups, list app versions and much more
- **Generate screenshots from your app** by selecting desired language, device, appearance, and more. All of this works by leveraging your existing test suite
- **Send push notifications** to your user's devices using Apple Push Notification Service or Firebase Cloud Messaging

If you want to see the full potential of the provided tools, you can generate and view the man pages with ease. To do so, please clone the repo and execute the following commands to view the man pages of all included tools (asc, snap, and push):

```shell
# Generate manpages
swift package plugin generate-manual

# copy man page of e.g. asc to a folder where `man` can find it
cp .build/plugins/GenerateManual/outputs/asc/asc.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1/

# view the man page
man asc
```

## Installation

### Via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

```shell
brew tap Blackjacx/asc
brew install asc
```

### Via [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/mint)

Just install Mint using with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) via `brew install mint`.

```shell
mint install Blackjacx/Assist
```

You can also run command line tools with mint without installing them first. Mint will automatically clone and install it.

```shell
mint run git@github.com:Blackjacx/Assist.git asc apps
```

### Via Command Line

```shell
git clone https://github.com/blackjacx/assist.git AppStoreConnect
cd AppStoreConnect
swift run asc -h
```

## Documentation ASC (App Store Connect API CLI)

### Authentication

Authentication is handled by the tool itself. The only thing needed is your private API key. Generate one at [App Store Connect account](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/api) and execute the following command which will just store the exact parameters you provide in the user defaults.

```shell
asc keys register -n "name" -k "key-id" -i "issuer-id" -p "path-to-private-key-file"
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è No key generation performed here. The JWT is just generated on demand when using this tool. If you have multiple keys registered, the activated key is automatically used (see `asc keys activate`). For each command you can also use the `-k` option to specify the ID of a prevously registered key.

### Sub Commands

Here are some examples of what the tool can do for you:

```shell
# list all registered API keys
asc api-keys list

# register API key for specific team
asc api-keys register -n "name" -k "key-id" -i "issuer-id" -p "path-to-private-key-file"

# delete API key for specific team
asc api-keys delete -k "key-id"



# list is the default
asc beta-groups

# list only beta groups with a specific name
asc beta-groups -g "group-name"



# list apps of your team
asc apps



# add beta tester to all groups matching `group-name`
asc beta-testers add -e "john@doe.com" -n "John" -l "Doe" -g "group-name"

# add beta tester to all groups matching all specified group names
asc beta-testers add -e "john@doe.com" -n "John" -l "Doe" -g "group-name-1" -g "group-name-2"



# delete beta tester from all groups found
asc beta-testers delete -e "john@doe.com"



# lists all your teams apps with their live version or if not live with their current status
asc app-store-versions
```

> [!tip]
> If you want a complete list, of all commands, just call `asc -h` you can call for help for every sub command, e.g. `asc builds -h` or `asc builds list -h`. 
>
> If you'd like to see a documentation of all commands with all sub commands, please run the following to generate and install the man page for `asc` as mentioned under [Features](#Features) üëç
