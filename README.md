# App Store Connect API ‚Ä¢ CLI

App Store Connect API access using your private API key. The great power of this tool is that it can operate on all apps of one or multiple teams (is you wish to), e.g. it is super easy to print the live versions of all of your apps, even across multiple teams:

```sh
asc app-store-versions list -k <key_id_1> \
asc app-store-versions list -k <key_id_2> \
asc app-store-versions list -k <key_id_3>
```

## Installation

### Via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

```sh
brew tap Blackjacx/asc
brew install asc
```

### Via [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/mint)

Just install Mint using with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) via `brew install mint`.

```sh
mint install Blackjacx/Assist
```

You can also run command line tools with mint without installing them first. Mint will automatically clone and install it.

```sh
mint run git@github.com:Blackjacx/Assist.git asc apps
```

### Via Command Line

```sh
git clone https://github.com/blackjacx/assist.git AppStoreConnect
cd AppStoreConnect
swift run asc -h
```

## Authentication

Authentication is handled by the tool itself. The only thing needed is your private API key. Generate one at [App Store Connect account](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/api) and execute the following command which will just store the exact parameters you provide in the user defaults.

```sh
asc api-keys register -n "name" -k "key-id" -i "issuer-id" -p "path-to-private-key-file"
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è No key generation performed here. The JWT is just generated on demand when using this tool. If you have multiple keys registered the tool will ask you which one you want to use.

## Sub Commands

Executing one of the following sub commands is as easy as appending it with its parameters to the base command:

```sh
# list all registered API keys
asc api-keys list

# register API key for specific team
asc api-keys register -n "name" -k "key-id" -i "issuer-id" -p "path-to-private-key-file"

# delete API key for specific team
asc api-keys delete -k "key-id"



# list is the default
asc beta-groups

# list only beta groups with a specific name
asc beta-groups -g "group-name"



# list apps of your team
asc apps



# add beta tester to all groups matching `group-name`
asc beta-testers add -e "john@doe.com" -n "John" -l "Doe" -g "group-name"

# add beta tester to all groups matching all specified group names
asc beta-testers add -e "john@doe.com" -n "John" -l "Doe" -g "group-name-1" -g "group-name-2"



# delete beta tester from all groups found
asc beta-testers delete -e "john@doe.com"
