App Store Connect API access using your private API key. The tool is in an early stage but already quite versatile ü•≥

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently this repository contains a collection of command line tools. This is the reason why it is called "Assist". But in future I want to focus on the App Store Connect API here.

## General

You can quickly try it out by using [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint). Just install it with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) via `brew install mint`. Then you can run each command by letting mint automatically clone and install it. Just prefix each command below with `mint run git@github.com:Blackjacx/Assist.git`, e.g.:

```shell
$ mint run git@github.com:Blackjacx/Assist.git asc groups -g <group_name>
```

## Authentication

Authentication is handled by the tool itself. The only thing needed is your private API key. Generate one at [App Store Connect account](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/api) and execute the following command which will just store the exact parameters you provide in the user defaults. 

```shell
asc api-keys register -n "name" -k "key-id" -i "issuer-id" -p "path-to-private-key-file"
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è No key generation performed here. The JWT is just generated on demand when using this tool. If you have multiple keys registered the tool will ask you which one you want to use.

## Sub Commands

Executing one of the following sub commands is as easy as appending it with its parameters to the base command:

```shell
# list all registered API keys
asc api-keys list

# register API key for specific team
asc api-keys register -n "name" -k "key-id" -i "issuer-id" -p "path-to-private-key-file"

# delete API key for specific team
asc api-keys delete -k "key-id"



# list is the default 
asc groups                                

# list only groups with a specific name
asc groups -g "group-name"



# list apps of your team
asc apps



# add beta tester to all groups matching `group-name`
asc beta-testers add -e "john@doe.com" -n "John" -l "Doe" -g "group-name"

# add beta tester to all groups matching all specified group names
asc beta-testers add -e "john@doe.com" -n "John" -l "Doe" -g "group-name-1" -g "group-name-2"



# delete beta tester from all groups found
asc beta-testers delete -e "john@doe.com"



# lists all your teams apps with their live version or if not live with their current status
asc app-store-versions
```
